Hi,

1. Geofences are created by parsing the GPX file. So all the coordinates will have a Geofence each
2. Once the Start is clicked, it'll start monitoring for all the Geofences.
3. In the debug mode, location can be simulated from GPX file.
4. The event log displays monitor status and Enter/Exit of Geofences.

Thanks,
Madhan
